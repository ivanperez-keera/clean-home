This program scans your $HOME dir and checks each element
whose name begins with . (dot) against a database of know
configuration files. From that, it determines the program
(or the package name, if you use search-by-package) that
may need that file/dir, and checks whether that program is
installed in your system.

There are two ways of finding programs:
1) By program name: searches for the config filepath in a
DB of program names. If a program is found, it checks whether
that program exists with `which`.

2) By package name: searches for the config filepath in a
DB of package names. If a package is found, it checks whether
that package is installed with apt-get. This makes clean-home
dependent on Debian/Deb-based OSs. I'll work to get that
fixed. You can request that clean-home uses a different tool
by providing the name and args to be passed to that tool.
By default, an empty result is considered a fail and a non-empty
result is conceived as a match, but you can request to use
the exit code to determine whether packages are installed or
not.

Run clean-home --help to see the complete set of options that
clean-home accepts.
